# System32 Deletion Simulator 🎭

A harmless PowerShell prank script that simulates the deletion of Windows System32 files for educational purposes.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This script is 100% HARMLESS!** It does NOT actually delete or modify any system files. It's a simulation designed to demonstrate the importance of cybersecurity awareness and why you should never run untrusted scripts with administrator privileges.

## 🎯 Purpose

This script serves as an educational tool to:
- Demonstrate the dangers of running unknown scripts from the internet
- Show how easily users can be tricked by realistic-looking system operations
- Teach cybersecurity awareness through a memorable (and harmless) experience
- Remind users to always verify scripts before execution

## 🎪 What It Does

The script creates a realistic simulation of:
- System privilege checking
- Windows protection bypassing
- System32 file deletion with progress bars
- Registry corruption messages
- Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) warnings
- Emergency shutdown countdown
- Voice narration for added realism

**But remember: IT'S ALL FAKE!** No actual system modifications occur.
