A harmless PowerShell prank script that simulates the deletion of Windows System32 files for **educational purposes**.

---

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This script is 100% HARMLESS!**  
It does **NOT** actually delete or modify any system files.  
It's a **simulation** designed to demonstrate the importance of cybersecurity awareness and why you should never run untrusted scripts with administrator privileges.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This script serves as an educational tool to:

- Demonstrate the dangers of running unknown scripts from the internet  
- Show how easily users can be tricked by realistic-looking system operations  
- Teach cybersecurity awareness through a memorable (and harmless) experience  
- Remind users to always verify scripts before execution  

---

## 🎪 What It Does

The script creates a realistic simulation of:

- System privilege checking  
- Windows protection bypassing  
- System32 file deletion with progress bars  
- Registry corruption messages  
- Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) warnings  
- Emergency shutdown countdown  
- Voice narration for added realism  

**But remember: IT'S ALL FAKE! 🚫**  
No actual system modifications occur.
